			<h1><b><u>Painter</u></b></h1>
				<p>A person who paints is called a <span>painter</span>.A person who draws is probably just called an artist, although if the person has a specialty he or she might also be called an illustrator, a portraitist, a sketch artist, an urban sketcher, a calligrapher, or whatever the artist is best known for.</p><br>
			<h2>Top 3 painters</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Pablo Picasso</b> : Picasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years, painting in a naturalistic manner through his childhood and adolescence. During the first decade of the 20th century, his style changed as he experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas. After 1906, the Fauvist work of the slightly older artist Henri Matisse motivated Picasso to explore more radical styles, beginning a fruitful rivalry between the two artists, who subsequently were often paired by critics as the leaders of modern art.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>leonardo da vinci</b> : Leonardo is renowned primarily as a painter. <span>The Mona Lisa</span> is the most famous of his works and the most popular portrait ever made.The Last Supper is the most reproduced religious painting of all time and his Vitruvian Man drawing is regarded as a cultural icon as well.Salvator Mundi was sold for a world record $450.3 million at a Christie's auction in New York, 15 November 2017, the highest price ever paid for a work of art.Leonardo's paintings and preparatory drawings—together with his notebooks, which contain sketches, scientific diagrams, and his thoughts on the nature of painting—compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled only by that of his contemporary Michelangelo.</li><br>
				<li><b>Vincent Willem van Gogh</b> : Van Gogh was unsuccessful during his lifetime, and was considered a madman and a failure. He became famous after his suicide, and exists in the public imagination as the quintessential misunderstood genius, the artist "where discourses on madness and creativity converge".His reputation began to grow in the early 20th century as elements of his painting style came to be incorporated by the Fauves and German Expressionists. He attained widespread critical, commercial and popular success over the ensuing decades, and is remembered as an important but tragic painter, whose troubled personality typifies the romantic ideal of the tortured artist. Today, Van Gogh's works are among the world's most expensive paintings to have ever sold, and his legacy is honoured by a museum in his name, 
					<span>the Van Gogh Museum</span> in Amsterdam, which holds the world's largest collection of his paintings and drawings.</li>
